## Front-End

Practiced responsiveness on most of the elements and sections of the page. Try them yourself, but don't go below 768px breakpoint !

## Back-End

Linked my page to a server and a database so that you can use the "Sign-Up" ("S'inscrire") button. Haven't figured out a way to display an error when user email already exists in database, but other than that it works just fine !
